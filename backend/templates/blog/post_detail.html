                            Science is an enterprise that should be cherished as an activity
                            of the free human mind. Because it transforms who we are, how we
                            live, and it gives us an understanding of our place in the
                            universe.

                            The universe is large and old, and the ingredients for life as we
                            know it are everywhere, so there's no reason to think that Earth
                            would be unique in that regard. Whether of not the life became
                            intelligent is a different question, and we'll see if we find
                            that.

                            If you get asteroids about a kilometer in size, those are large
                            enough and carry enough energy into our system to disrupt
                            transportation, communication, the food chains, and that can be a
                            really bad day on Earth.

                            For me, the most fascinating interface is Twitter. I have odd
                            cosmic thoughts every day and I realized I could hold them to
                            myself or share them with people who might be interested.

                            Venus has a runaway greenhouse effect. I kind of want to know what
                            happened there because we're twirling knobs here on Earth without
                            knowing the consequences of it. Mars once had running water. It's
                            bone dry today. Something bad happened there as well.
